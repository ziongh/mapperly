# v4.0

[![Release notes v4.0.0](https://img.shields.io/badge/Release_notes-v4.0-green?style=flat-square)](https://github.com/riok/mapperly/releases/tag/v4.0.0)
[![NuGet v4.0.0](https://img.shields.io/badge/NuGet-v4.0-blue?style=flat-square)](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Riok.Mapperly/4.0.0)

## Migration guide from v3.6.0

- `MapPropertyAttribute.ctor(string[], string[])` is marked as obsolete, replace either with `MapPropertyAttribute.ctor(string[], string)` or `MapPropertyAttribute.ctor(string, string[])`.
- Strict mappings are enabled by default, either use `MapperAttribute.RequiredMappingStrategy`/`MapperRequiredMappingAttribute` or revert to non-strict mappings (see [strict mappings by default](#strict-mappings-by-default)).
- If the `ExplicitCast` conversion is disabled, disable the new `EnumUnderlyingType` conversion too.
- Members of foreach mappings are now mapped, which may result in additional members being mapped or new diagnostics being reported.
- To account for changed diagnostics adjust your `.editorconfig` as needed, see [updated diagnostics](#updated-diagnostics).

## MapPropertyAttribute constructors

Since Mapperly does not support source nested member to target nested member mappings,
the constructor `MapPropertyAttribute.ctor(string[], string[])` is marked as obsolete
and will be removed in a future release.
Use `MapPropertyAttribute.ctor(string[], string)` or `MapPropertyAttribute.ctor(string, string[])` instead.

## Strict mappings by default

Starting with v4.0 Mapperly enables strict mappings by default with a severity of `Warning`.
Either apply `MapperAttribute.RequiredMappingStrategy`/`MapperRequiredMappingAttribute` or
revert the change by setting the severity of `RMG012`, `RMG020`, `RMG037` and `RMG038` back to `suggestion`.
See [EditorConfig](../configuration/analyzer-diagnostics/index.mdx#editorconfig)
on how to set the default severity of a given diagnostic.

## Enum underlying type conversion

A new `EnumUnderlyingType` conversion is added.
Whenever Mapperly tries to map from/to an enum and does not succeed,
Mapperly tries to map from/to the underlying type of the enum and explicitly cast the resulting value to the enum type.
Until v3.6.0 Mapperly used the `ExplicitCast` to enable/disable this conversion.
Starting with v4.0 Mapperly introduces a new `EnumUnderlyingType` conversion to enable/disable this conversion.

## ForEach member mappings

ForEach mappings now also map members and constructor parameters the same way as regular object-to-object mappings.
This may break existing code because a member that wasn't mapped before may now be mapped.
New diagnostics can also be reported for existing mappings
(e.g., if a new member is being mapped, but Mapperly cannot create a conversion for its types).

## Updated diagnostics

The following diagnostics are changed, removed or replaced.
You may need to update the `.editorconfig` files and your Mapperly configuration code.
See [EditorConfig](../configuration/analyzer-diagnostics/index.mdx#editorconfig)
on how to set the default severity of a given diagnostic.

| `RMG017` | `RMG017: An init only member can have one configuration at max` and `RMG027: A constructor parameter can have one configuration at max` are merged into the new `RMG074: Multiple mappings are configured for the same target member` |

| `RMG026` | `RMG026: Cannot map from indexed member` is removed, starting with 4.0 indexed members are ignored                                                                                                                                    |
| `RMG028` | `RMG028: Constructor parameter cannot handle target paths` is removed as this is now supported.                                                                                                                                       |
| `RMG012` | Starting with v4.0 Mapperly enables strict mappings by default with a level of `warning`. The default severity of `RMG012: Source member was not found for target member` changes from `Info` to `Warning`.                           |
| `RMG020` | Starting with v4.0 Mapperly enables strict mappings by default with a level of `warning`. The default severity of `RMG020: Source member is not mapped to any target member` changes from `Info` to `Warning`.                        |
| `RMG037` | Starting with v4.0 Mapperly enables strict mappings by default with a level of `warning`. The default severity of `RMG037: An enum member could not be found on the source enum` changes from `Info` to `Warning`.                    |
| `RMG038` | Starting with v4.0 Mapperly enables strict mappings by default with a level of `warning`. The default severity of `RMG038: An enum member could not be found on the target enum` changes from `Info` to `Warning`.                    |
