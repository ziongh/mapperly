# RMG066 — No members are mapped in an object mapping

If Mapperly maps to an object without mapping any member, `RMG066` is emitted.

The generated implementation part of the mapping method usually looks like this:

```csharp
public partial Target Map(Source source)
{
    var target = new Target();
    return target;
}
```

Usually this is not expected.
